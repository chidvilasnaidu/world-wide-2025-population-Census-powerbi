## 📋 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides comprehensive analysis of global population trends projected for 2025, with particular focus on:

- **Urbanization patterns** and rural-urban distribution  
- **Fertility rates** across continents and countries  
- **Migration trends** and population changes  
- **Comparative analysis** between major population centers  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings
- 🇮🇳 **India** and 🇨🇳 **China** are projected to remain the most populous nations in 2025  
- 🌍 **Africa** stands out as the most fertile continent, indicating rapid population growth  
- **Top urban-dwelling countries**: Sint Maarten, Belgium, Guam, Macao, Western Sahara  
- 🌆 Majority of the global population still resides in **rural areas**
